# ASCII Machine

ASCII Machine is a sandbox game, in which you can build RubeÂ Goldberg-style machines using nothing but text.

You write and run machines directly in the Editor, which colors the different components as you type them. You can then switch to Simulation mode, and see the machine spring to life in place.

# Trying out

The best way to try out ASCII Machine is to open [the examples](http://github.com/cykelero/asciimachine/blob/master/documentation/Examples.txt) in a tab, and try them out directly in [the Editor](http://www.cykeprojects.com/asciiMachine.html). Press `Shift+Enter` after you've pasted a machine to immediately see it in action.

And when you start making your own machines, make sure to keep the [Quick Reference](http://github.com/cykelero/asciimachine/blob/master/documentation/Quick%20reference.txt)
 handy.

# Compiling

To compile, just run `workingSource/compile.php`, and the build files will be generated in `build`.

ASCII Machine is written using SVP2.js, an opinionated OO framework, and may consequently look weird.
